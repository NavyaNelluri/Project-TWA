<p>
Above is the initial approach to this project.
1. On the first go, we will ask job seejers and employers to fill out the google forms.
2. We will thenextract the information in .CSV format and then load it to database.
3. On the next step, we create framework that access the database data.
  Framework includes:
  1. connection to the database
  2. loading data.
  3. retrieving data.
  4. mapping job seekers to the appropriate job positions
4. This mapped data will be available on the front end either by sorting based on employer details or with the job positions.
